# Automate-The-Boring-Stuff-With-Python

This is the notes that i've written down and some practice questions i've tried doing by learning through a course.
The course name is Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart, available in udemy

This course covers python basic, web scraping, pythonautogui, sending/checking emails, and reading/writing files(text file, binary-file, docx, pdf, xlsx_

Since the course is quite old, there are some lessons which i can't follow (due to my laptop somehow can't install the library/can't compile them, even if i copy paste)
